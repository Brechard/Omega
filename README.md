# Omega
In OMEGA, players try to create groups of their colors by placing stones in a hexagonal grid, in order to score the most points. 
The final score for each color is calculated by multiplying the sizes of the different groups of that color.

The purpose of this project is first designing the board game in the any programming language. Java was chosen for this project because
it is a language that is both fast and easy to use. Once the game implemented an Alpha-Beta based framework to play the game. 

The search techniques implemented to make the algorithm faster are:
  - Windows
  - Transposition tables
  - Aspiration search
  - Iterative deepening
  - Union Find
  - Move ordering
  - Killer move
